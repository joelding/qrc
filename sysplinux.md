* Effect of usleep(0)

  usleep(0) appears in libvisca.c. The usleep() function suspends execution of the calling thread for __at least__ given microseconds. The value passed is used as a minimum. The system is free to use the smallest possible interval instead. [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12823598/effect-of-usleep0-in-c-on-linux)
