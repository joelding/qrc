# UNIT TESTING
2018/11/30 Eric Yao discussed with me Ted Tai promoted this ides. The first team asked to implement was Nock.
About this topic, I felt interested because I thought unit testing is a part of programming and I had no idea at all how to do it. During the talk, I quickly asked questions:
1. With what tool can I proceed unit testing?
2. What should I program to proceed a unit testing?
3. Style and Steve worked on this topic. What had they achieved? How did they feel about their progress? Why not follow their steps and continue what they were doing?

## The three core skills of successful TDD
1. knowing how to write good tests
  * Manning, the art of unit testing, e/2, 2014
1. writing them test-first
  * Beck, Test-Driven Development: by Example, 2002
1. designing them well
  * Freeman, Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests, 2009
  * Martin, Clean Code, 2008
