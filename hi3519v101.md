#### How does the kernel inform an application about interrupts?

There are several mechanisms for this. First approach: user-space application makes poll() or select() system call, waiting for some event from kernel. Second approach is to use Netlink sockets. There are also others like mmap() or signals. Google by kernel user-space IPC and you will see the whole list.

As for your case (drivers development), I'd say go with next approach. Create sysfs file in your driver, and do sysfs_notify() (and maybe wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout() or something like that). In user-space do select() system call for your driver sysfs file. See how line discipline installed from user-space for example.

Some built-in drivers have already registered interrupts. How to get interrupt information from them?

#### i2c tools for linux

* originally: lm-sensors package

`````
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/i2c-tools/i2c-tools.git
`````
or download from [link](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/utils/i2c-tools/)

* compile by
````````
$ CC=arm-hisiv500-linux-gcc make
````````

#### How to create multiple instances, one for each device, with the same driver? 2018/07/13

* similar to what Lenz Moser asked [link](http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/kernel/132637-how-load-kernel-module-twice.html)
````````````````````
# insmod a.ko param=0
# insmod a.ko param=1
....
# insmod a.ko param=7
````````````````````

dev_alloc_name(<name>)

insmod: can't insert 'avt_tlv320aic31.ko': File exists

#### How to know which node or path the application open with?

````````````````````````````
struct file *filp;

filp->f_path.dentry->d_iname;
````````````````````````````
