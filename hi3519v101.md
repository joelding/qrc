#### HOW TO USE A GPIO KEY AS A RESET BUTTON 

reference: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/input/gpio-keys.txt

To enable interrupt mode, the kernel needs to enable input device driver. CONFIG_KEYBOARD_GPIO/CONFIG_KEYBOARD_GPIO_POLLED should stay active.

The device tree needs some fixes:
`````````````````````
/ {
	gpio_keys {
		compatible = "gpio-keys";
		button {
			label = "avt_reset";
			gpios = <&gpio_chip3 7 0>; /* GPIO3_7 */
			linux,code = <90>; /* code to emit - as keyboard */
		};
	};
};
`````````````````````
Rebuild the kernel and run, /proc/interrupts show interrupts coming in.
`````````````````````
~ # cat /proc/interrupts 
           CPU0       CPU1   
159:          7          0     pl061   7  avt_reset
`````````````````````

The application be be written as following:
`````````````````````
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <linux/input.h>

#define DEV "/dev/input/event0"

#define TESTCNT (10)
#define PRGM "test_rstbtnevent"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        int fd, count = 0;
        struct input_event in;

        fd = open(DEV, O_RDWR);
        if (fd < 0) {
                printf("[%s] ERR! FAIL TO OPEN %s\n", PRGM, DEV);
                return -1;
        }

        printf("[%s] test reset button\n", PRGM);
        printf("[%s] you have to press %d times\n", PRGM, TESTCNT);
        while (count < TESTCNT) {
                read(fd, &in, sizeof(struct input_event));
//              printf("%s: [%d] type=0x%x code=0x%x value=0x%x\n", PRGM, count, in.type, in.code, in.value);
                if ((in.type == EV_KEY) && // key event
                    (in.code == 90) && // key code, written in dts
                    (in.value == 0)) { // press down
                        printf("[%s] you press %d time(s)\n", PRGM, count + 1);
                        ++count;
                }
        }

        close(DEV);
        printf("[%s] exit", PRGM);
        return 0;
}
`````````````````````
#### How does the kernel inform an application about interrupts?

There are several mechanisms for this. First approach: user-space application makes poll() or select() system call, waiting for some event from kernel. Second approach is to use Netlink sockets. There are also others like mmap() or signals. Google by kernel user-space IPC and you will see the whole list.

As for your case (drivers development), I'd say go with next approach. Create sysfs file in your driver, and do sysfs_notify() (and maybe wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout() or something like that). In user-space do select() system call for your driver sysfs file. See how line discipline installed from user-space for example.

Some built-in drivers have already registered interrupts. How to get interrupt information from them?

#### i2c tools for linux

* originally: lm-sensors package

`````
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/i2c-tools/i2c-tools.git
`````
or download from [link](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/utils/i2c-tools/)

* compile by
````````
$ CC=arm-hisiv500-linux-gcc make

#### How to know which node or path the application open with?

````````````````````````````
struct file *filp;

filp->f_path.dentry->d_iname;
